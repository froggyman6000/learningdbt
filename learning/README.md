### Working test scenario of using a select statement with a JSON object to create a new table on PostgreSQL

You need to be inside the 'learning' directory to execute dbt commands correctly.

dbt test - tests if the models pass
dbt debug - tests if there are no errors and if connection to the database is good
dbt run - runs dbt
